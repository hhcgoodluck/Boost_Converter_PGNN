# Boost_Converter_PGNN
This project focuses on predicting power losses of key components (capacitor, inductor, diode, and MOSFET) in a DC-DC Boost Converter
Using Physics-Guided Neural Networks (PGNN). We integrate circuit simulation data with domain knowledge to improve the accuracy and physical consistency of loss estimation across different circuit conditions.
